+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:  _0_ / _1_ :  Check that a GoogleTest test passes. (Test not run because of an earlier failing test)

+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:  _0_ / _50_ :  Check project was submitted on time. (Test not run because of an earlier failing test)

+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:  _0_ / _10_ :  Program can be compiled and for grading based on the version submitted in github at the deadline. (Test not run because of an earlier failing test)


### Assignment Tests


#### Work in the "C" Range

+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:  _0_ / _8_ :  The correct current transformation matrix is used for drawing each bone (Test not run because of an earlier failing test)

+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:  _0_ / _7_ :  The child_root_transform is correctly set before the recursive call at the end of the function. (Test not run because of an earlier failing test)


#### Work in the "B" Range

+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:  _0_ / _4_ :  Draw at least a stick fgure (e.g., line segment or cylinder) representation for the each bone (Test not run because of an earlier failing test)

+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:  _0_ / _4_ :  Four additional special motions are defined, loaded, trimmed, and then played. (Test not run because of an earlier failing test)

+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:  _0_ / _2_ :  Motions smoothly transition from the ballet dancerâ€™s base loop motion into all of these special motions whenever a new motion is played. (Test not run because of an earlier failing test)


#### Work in the "A" Range

+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:  _0_ / _4_ :  QuickShapes are used to draw simple geometries like spheres, cubes, cylinders, cones, etc.. (Test not run because of an earlier failing test)

+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:  _0_ / _3_ :  Transformation matrices (Matrix4s) are used to apply scales, translations, and rotations to the model matrix. (Test not run because of an earlier failing test)

+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:  _0_ / _3_ :  Colors and several geometries are used to make a convincing character. (Test not run because of an earlier failing test)

#### Total score: _3_ / _100_
