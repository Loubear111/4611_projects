## Assessment for Assignment 03 (Graded by: Nikki Kyllonen)

#### Total score: _97_ / _100_

#### Necessary Files and Structure (_50_ / _50_)

+ :heavy_check_mark: Path exists: dev/a3-earthquake





#### Rubric (_47_ / _50_)

#### Work in the "C" Range:

+ :heavy_check_mark: _20.0_ / _20_ : Rectangle mesh is initially rendered to the screen. (Regardless of texturing.)

+ :x: _5.0_ / _6_ : 'Toggle Debug Mode' shows edges of each triangle in the mesh and the mesh is subdivided into slices and stacks.
   >Sometimes the horizontal portions of the mesh don't show up in the flat map? They reappear when switching to the globe, but diappear when switching back to the flat map. (-1)

+ :heavy_check_mark: _3.0_ / _3_ : QuakeApp uses a helper function for calculating flat positions from latitude and longitude values.



#### Work in the "B" Range:

+ :heavy_check_mark: _3.0_ / _3_ : Earth is rendered as a textured rectangle.

+ :heavy_check_mark: _4.0_ / _4_ : Earthquakes are visualized at the correct locations on the rectangle.

+ :heavy_check_mark: _3.0_ / _3_ : Earthquake visualizations use sizes and colors in meaningful ways.




#### Work in the "C" Range:

+ :x: _2.0_ / _3_ : Earth and QuakeApp classes use a helper function for calculating sphere positions from latitude and longitude values.
   >Sphere coordinates helper function is not used by Earth class. (-1)

+ :heavy_check_mark: _2.0_ / _2_ : Sphere mesh is rendered to screen. (Regardless of texturing.)

+ :heavy_check_mark: _2.0_ / _2_ : Earth is rendered as a textured sphere. (Abrupt transition allowed.)

+ :heavy_check_mark: _2.0_ / _2_ : Earthquakes are visualized at the correct locations on the sphere.

+ :x: _1.0_ / _2_ : Mesh smoothly transforms between the flat map and the globe using member variables of the Earth class which contain flat vertices and spherical vertices.
   >Earth class does not contain member variables for flat and spherical vertices. (-1)



#### Additional Comments:

+ _0.0_ / _0_ : Comments:
   >Great job! Good README notes. Good use of code snippets.
