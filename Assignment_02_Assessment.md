#### Rubric (_48_ / _50_)

#### Work in the "C" Range:

+ _15.0_ / _15_ : Draw field lines and both goals.

+ _4.0_ / _4_ : Random initial velocity for ball (SPACEBAR launch).
<pre></b>Spacebar should reset the ball's position to the center AND give it a random velocity. You only give the ball a new velocity, without resetting the position.</b></pre>

+ _5.0_ / _5_ : Ball moves according to gravitational acceleration.

+ _5.0_ / _5_ : Ball correctly bounces off of the pitch.



#### Work in the "B" Range:

+ _4.0_ / _4_ : Ball correctly bounces off of the walls and ceiling.

+ _3.0_ / _3_ : Car remains within the bounds of the pitch.

+ _3.0_ / _3_ : Ball looses speed when it bounces.




#### Work in the "C" Range:

+ _3.0_ / _3_ : Ball bounces off of the car with the correct collision normal.

+ _1.0_ / _2_ : Ball incorporates velocity of the Car when hit.
<pre></b>Ball bounces off with such great velocity every time that it's hard to tell if the car's velocity is affecting it. (-1)</b></pre>

+ _4.0_ / _4_ : Car has a realistic driving model.
<pre></b>Found driving model somewhat hard to control.</b></pre>

+ _1.0_ / _2_ : Ball and Car are reset when a goal is made.
<pre></b>Car is not reset after a goal. (-1)</b></pre>



#### Additional Comments:

+ _0.0_ / _0_ : Comments:
<pre></b>Good README notes!</b></pre>
